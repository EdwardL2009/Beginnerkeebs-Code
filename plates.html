        There are many different options for plates that affect the sound and typing feel of a keyboard. Options include aluminum, carbon fiber, steel, brass, polycarbonate, POM, and FR4 plates. As explained by Keybored in his video, the sound produced from a board depends on the stiffness and weight of a plate. The heavier and more flexible a plate is, the more “thocky” and deep sounding it is. The lighter and stiffer a plate is, the more “clacky” and higher pitched it is. This, of course, is not all that changes the sound of a keyboard. For “thockier” builds, keyboard builders tend to use PC (polycarbonate), POM, or FR4. For more “clacky” builds, builders tend to use brass or carbon fiber. Stock keyboards or pre-builts tend to come with aluminum or steel plates. They are a good middle-ground between the “clacky” and “thocky”. Most come with aluminum, as it’s cheaper, but companies that want to make their keyboards heavier and more substantial choose steel.
