        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a plethora of sizes and layouts available for keyboards. The most common layout is the 100%. This is your standard keyboard with 108 keys. An example would be the Akko 5108S keyboard.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next would be the TKL, which stands for ten-key-less. This is also sometimes referred to as 87%. This retains all the basic keys, such as the function keys and arrow keys, but doesn&#8217;t include the number pad. Most people do not use the number pad, so they purchase this to save space. Examples include the Tiger 80 Lite and the CIY X77.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smaller than the 100% is the 96% keyboard. It has almost all the same keys as the full size, just the spaces are more compact. The nav cluster is relocated to above the number pad and two keys are removed. Fear not, however, as most keyboards allow you to remap those keys to the keys that you need. Good options for this are the Epomaker Theory TH96 or the Keebmonkey 1800.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smaller than the TKL is the 75%. This is most people&#8217;s sweet spot, as it has everything the average user needs. It has almost all the same keys as the TKL, just with less space in between the clusters. There are many options for 75% keyboards, such as the Feker IK75, Akko 5075S, Akko MOD007, or the GMMK Pro.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you tend not to use the function row less and feel comfortable using it through a separate layer, you can use the 65% layout. It retains almost all of the keys that the 75% has, but without the function row and most of the time it is missing one more nav key as well. Good examples are the MOD008, TH66/VN66, and TM680.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you do not need the arrow keys and are comfortable using a layer for those, you can get a 60. Usually, these are missing all of the navigation keys as well. They only have the bare minimum for typing comfortably. Examples would be the RK61, Keychron V4, and Tofu60.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also Alice keyboard layouts in multiple sizes, though most commonly found in the 65% size. These are split keyboards with a design that aims to make it more comfortable to type on.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;40% usually comes in multiple styles. There is the option for Ortholinear layouts or standard QWERTY. Ortholinear layouts are unique in which all the keys are stacked in perfect rows and columns, whereas QWERTY layouts have the standard layout, minus the number row.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, there are macro pads. These are very small and are just used as programmed buttons for specific tasks.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are all the standard layouts and most common. There are several more unique layouts that are interesting, such as >100% keyboards and more, but those are rare to see. There is no <q>best</q> size, as it is all personal preference. However, people tend to consider 65%-75% the sweet spot.</p>
